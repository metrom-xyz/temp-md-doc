# What is Metrom?

Metrom ( [https://metrom.xyz](https://metrom.xyz) ) is an efficient liquidity mining platform that AMMs, especially those based on concentrated liquidity AMMs, can use to incentivize liquidity providers (LPs) to ensure efficient distribution of incentives.

Metrom lets AMMs and project design their incentive structures to their liquidity providers by bringing flexibility and efficiency to incentives.

## For Campaign Creators

**What makes Metrom so powerful is its completely hands off approach.**&#x20;

Attract liquidity to your pair in three easy steps: \
\- pick the pool \
\- set the duration\
\- add rewards —it’s that simple.

**How Metrom Works:**&#x20;

We perform advanced off-chain computations to analyze on-chain liquidity positions.

As a result, rewards are allocated in direct proportion to the liquidity density (combination of size of the position and concentration range of each position), accurately reflecting the value each LP contributes to the pool.

### Benefits:

Metrom thrives on bringing flexibility to incentives.&#x20;

* **No more staking LP NFT for rewards**: Metrom calculates positions off-chain, eliminating the need for staking into and withdrawing from farming contracts. It calculates all positions off-chain and pushes the Merkle root on-chain for LPs to claim their incentives.
*   **KPI based campaigns**: Campaign creators can set emission goals based on a specified range of Total Value Locked (TVL) for their chosen pair. Actual emissions depend on achieving these goals. If the goal is not fully met, any unrewarded incentives are returned to the campaign creators, resulting in significant savings.

    This forward-thinking approach increases both the efficiency and effectiveness of incentive strategiesSet a TVL goal for your community to achieve and perform incentive payouts based on how much the goal is achieved.&#x20;
* **Range based rewards**: Pick a specific tick range that you would like to incentivize. Will help in receiving deep liquidity on stable pools.
* **Multi campaigns**: Create multiple campaigns in a single transaction. Efficient for AMMs that run multiple campaigns, eliminating the need to sign, approve, and execute multiple transactions.
